the last bull markets to take off we needed a surge of new/returning investors, that means big news in the crypto space for people to hype on and pile on.\n\nThe reality is though, even if tomorrow Vitalik announced a surprise Eth 3.0, with Sharding, Infinite scaling, and hookers, and blackjack too.  Or the governments around the world in a surprise move came to some global regulation that were surprisingly reasonable for everyone involved, even then though **crypto is NOT going to pump tomorrow**.\n\nSure no one really knows what the market holds, but we are in the middle of a major global recession, Inflation is hitting everyone hard, and governments as usual are slow to react.  Layoffs are happening in every sector, including the often untouched tech sector.  The hard truth is, no one is running out to buy bitcoin when they aren't sure if they will have to move when their landlord raises rent next month, or if they can afford food after another price increase.

also check the edit at the bottom for an update regarding lack of proof of reserves on the stables on BNB as well:\n\n**TLDR:** Binance fails to provide adequate proof of reserves for assets in the BNB chain. Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating \"fake crypto tokens\" in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....\n\n**What you need to know**\n\n* [BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918). Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use \"those assets\" in the Binance ecosystem.\n* As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating \"fake BNB tokens\" with no actual backing on the native chain.\n* To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing [Proof of Asset](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.\n   * The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.\n      * The [LTC proof of reserve address](https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6) holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94) and 132k in the [BEP2 addresses](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07) \\-  **87% backed**\n      * THE [ADA proof of reserve](https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9) address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in [BEP20 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) and 431M circulating in [BEP2 addresses](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47) \\- **29.7% backed**\n      * (very concerning) The following is the [listed](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof) proof of asset address [for ETHER](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59). It's supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec), labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can't verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - **0% verifiably backed**\n      * (very concerning and easier to understand) The [XRP](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5) proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn't show any tokens **it's easier to see how bad it is**. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza) \\- a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with [this wallet](https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr) \\- the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - **0% verifiably backed**\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nBinance lists 35 different crypto assets in their [Proof of Assets Page](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof), however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of \"proof of asset\" listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.\n\nEven for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn't mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n**Complications**: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue [6 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/). Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to \\~30%.\n\nIt continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network.

Binance encourages users to withdraw their crypto into the Binance ecosystem by charging higher fees to withdraw into native ecosystems - and are failing to Provide Proof of Assets altogether or a sufficient amount in their Proof of Assets for the crypto in the Binance ecosystem. This gives Binance a huge opportunity to manipulate the crypto market by creating &amp;quot;fake crypto tokens&amp;quot; in the BNB ecosystem that are not backed by any underlying asset and then selling/using your assets. Furthermore, it pushes volume into BNB chain by encouraging withdraws into the BNB ecosystem that may end up not backed by any assets....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918\"&gt;BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2 tokens) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 tokens) are two native chains of the Binance ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. Binance allows users to withdraw lots of different crypto as tokens into their native chains which then allows users the ability to use &amp;quot;those assets&amp;quot; in the Binance ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As you can imagine, this could create a few concerns... The largest being Binance could sell/send the underlying asset of the BEP2/20 Tokens as the user no longer holds the true crypto but a token on the Binance ecosystem, essentially allowing them to manipulate the total supply of those cryptos by creating &amp;quot;fake BNB tokens&amp;quot; with no actual backing on the native chain.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To ease concerns about artificial manipulation Binance began providing &lt;a href=\"https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof\"&gt;Proof of Asset&lt;/a&gt; wallets where, for crosschain assets (Ether, XRP, ADA, Doge, etc..) they should theoretically hold an underlying asset equal to the amount of the asset that is in the BEP2/20 ecosystem. This is supposed to ensure the Binance asset you are holding is backed by an equal amount on its native chain and the supply is not being artificially manipulated.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The problem however is they do not provide a Proof of Asset list for most of their assets in the Binance ecosystem. Additionally of those that have a Proof of Asset wallet, most are not fully backed or actually list no real backing at all.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/MQSs17ECe51kqhkFPQY98wiyPvGuK5iCB6\"&gt;LTC proof of reserve address&lt;/a&gt; holds 745K LTC. However there are 857k LTC in the BNB ecosystem - 725k in the &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x4338665cbb7b2485a8855a139b75d5e34ab0db94\"&gt;BEP20 addresses&lt;/a&gt; and 132k in the &lt;a href=\"https://explorer.bnbchain.org/asset/LTC-F07\"&gt;BEP2 addresses&lt;/a&gt; -  &lt;strong&gt;87% backed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;THE &lt;a href=\"https://explorer.cardano.org/en/address?address=addr1q8hsff3uwtphx7dtya7unjwjwug52e5jvqp09je6pwqx8k4jvuxrw2x5rr7e258a33yzkrhhlrrc5ezvd2z7qtdq0gasme44c9\"&gt;ADA proof of reserve&lt;/a&gt; address holds 200M ADA. However there are 672M ADA in the BNB ecosystem - 241M circulating in &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47\"&gt;BEP20 addresses&lt;/a&gt; and 431M circulating in &lt;a href=\"https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47\"&gt;BEP2 addresses&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;29.7% backed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(very concerning) The following is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof\"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; proof of asset address &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4001d307dFd62B26A2F1307ee0C0307632d59\"&gt;for ETHER&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s supposed to hold all of the ETHER on the BNB ecosystem but it currently sits at .017 ETH and the ETHER was moved to &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec\"&gt;this address&lt;/a&gt;, labeled as Binance 8. The BNB ETHER reserves were comingled with non-BNB reserve ether, meaning you can&amp;#39;t verify how much the BNB Ether is backed verse regular user funds. - &lt;strong&gt;0% verifiably backed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(very concerning and easier to understand) The &lt;a href=\"https://xrpscan.com/account/rJpj1Mv21gJzsbsVnkp1U4nqchZbmZ9pM5\"&gt;XRP&lt;/a&gt; proof of reserves wallet for the BNB Chain is just as bad as the ETHER but since it doesn&amp;#39;t show any tokens &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;#39;s easier to see how bad it is&lt;/strong&gt;. It holds a total of 10 XRP. The rest was transferred to &lt;a href=\"https://xrpscan.com/account/rs8ZPbYqgecRcDzQpJYAMhSxSi5htsjnza\"&gt;this wallet&lt;/a&gt; - a general Binance wallet for XRP, which interacts with &lt;a href=\"https://xrpscan.com/account/rDAE53VfMvftPB4ogpWGWvzkQxfht6JPxr\"&gt;this wallet&lt;/a&gt; - the withdrawal address for users of XRP. Again all XRP in the BNB reserves have been comingled with regular user funds not in BNB. with no way to verify they hold sufficient XRP in the BNB chain. - &lt;strong&gt;0% verifiably backed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Binance lists 35 different crypto assets in their &lt;a href=\"https://www.bnbchain.org/en/assets-proof\"&gt;Proof of Assets Page&lt;/a&gt;, however in the top 200 cryptos by market cap, over 80 of them can be withdrawn as BEP2/20 tokens. Meaning there are at least 45 cryptos assets that do not have any sort of &amp;quot;proof of asset&amp;quot; listed. The total number of unbacked assets is even higher, as there are assets above 200+ by marketcap that can be withdrawn into the Binance ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even for assets that have a proof of reserve listed that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is adequately backed or backed at all. For example; ETH ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, XRP ERC2/20 tokens have no verifiable backing, ADA ERC2/20 tokens are 29.7% backed. LTC ERC2/20 tokens are 86.9% backed and those are just a few of the listed assets that I checked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complications&lt;/strong&gt;: This problem has been unchecked and inflated since, I posted about this issue &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uz09wu/binance_is_encouraging_withdrawingminting_your/\"&gt;6 months ago&lt;/a&gt;. Since then XRP and ETHER have lost all verifiable backing and ADA backing dropped from 71% to ~30%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It continues to be compounded by the fact that Binance encourages users to send their crypto into BEP 2/20 tokens by making it more expensive to send the asset into the native chain. As an example Dogecoin costs 1.94 Doge to withdraw as a BEP 2/20 token and 5 Doge to withdraw into the native Dogecoin network. This is standard practice for &lt;a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee\"&gt;Binance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule\"&gt;BinanceUS&lt;/a&gt; for nearly all assets available to withdrawal into the Binance ecosystem, and the unbacked assets will likely continue to grow if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the last few weeks haven&amp;#39;t made it clear yet, the last people left holding unbacked assets end up with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Edit:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As pointed out by &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxxugl/comment/iwrfyhd/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3\"&gt;another user&lt;/a&gt; Binance also no longer has proof of reserves of the &lt;strong&gt;PAXD or the USDC stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt; both of which are still circulating in the BNB ecosystem.

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) claiming to have near 0 exposure to the fallout of FTX it's been discovered that they had, over the course of the last year sent multiple very large 10-40m stablecoin

\n\n\n[https:\\/\\/etherscan.io\\/tokentxns?a=0xadd6d754b48a7eb4b4a71651722666093f7bc5d9&amp;p=1](https://preview.redd.it/vv8k9gr3csz91.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d46d953d20027f3114af51a5dadff0503ff84a7f)\n\nTransactions

wallet addresses from [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) sending stablecoins to FTX in very large numbers over the course of the last year, possibly to farm the high interest rates they were offering at
