DM and Manager should've told me to close the store for a few hours at least. Waited an hour for someone to show up just to cover 2 transactions while I was gone...(I** ***did*** **have a final convo with my granddad, but it should've been at the house, not the hospital).**\n\nWhen I opened the day before Elden Ring's release, the alarm code my manager let me use since Sept. wasn't working because he was relocated to another store; the alarm wouldn't stop for almost 2 hours. The police showed up and I was given my own alarm code. My first bad experience this year.\n\n**Manager 2 (The Witch) -** New manager shows up and she's terrible. Made us sneak a 1 year warranty onto PS5 bundles. At the time, I was powerless and didn't want to go against her. I knew it was wrong, though, and reported it to the DM back in June. I also initially quit when I met the DM because \"this\" manager was mean and demoralizing and made me hate showing up to work (She even made our last ASL quit, possibly due to racism, or just being *very* mean). When I told this manager about my meeting with the DM, she told me to \"go, move, I mean it\", and I slowly walked out of the back room. Then I propped the door open with a bungie cord and she was all like \"why do you need the door open?\" \"So you can watch me do this\" I put my keys down in front of her and walked out early that day (no way I was staying with her for 3 more hours...). I even recorded the whole interaction on my phone, but I will keep it for myself. \n\n**Pay -** New SGA hires are starting at 11, but I was making **8.75** at that same spot. I was an ASL for the last four and a half months making **12.10** (11 prior to the pay raise). I'm just thinking of all the money I *lost* by working here...I'm happy for my fellow workers but I'm just wondering where the money was for me...\n\nI almost felt bad leaving my (small) team before Black Friday, but I have to look after myself for once. I got close to 15 phone calls one day because they needed help and there was no one. The days off don't feel like days off. Even now that I quit, I *still* get some phone calls from work (I answered a few, but now I'm done). \n\n**The Call -** My grandfather died in August. Mom called me to tell me to go to his house (I knew what was going to happen). At that moment in time, I was unsure if I were allowed to close the store even for half an hour, and asked my Manager and DM. They should've told me to just close for the day (It was slow anyway...), but I will always blame myself in the end for not taking action. I had help arrive about an hour later, and when I recently asked him how many transactions he had while I was gone, he said \"about 2\" or so. By the time I arrived at the house, the ambulance had already taken him. I even mentioned this in my speech to the whole Church. \"It's not worth it\", I said. \"I missed him\"...\n\n**Toxic Customers -** There have been a lot of them lately. So much so that I have been intentionally opening late and closing early. (11 to 7? 12 to 6 for me) My energy and drive were depleted; **I wish the new guys could've seen me at my best...**\n\nDespite all, I left on good terms with my DM and other workers. I wish them and everyone reading this the best.\n\nRIP My GameStop Run, May 2021-November 2022.

DM and Manager should&amp;#39;ve told me to close the store for a few hours at least. Waited an hour for someone to show up just to cover 2 transactions while I was gone...(I&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;have a final convo with my granddad, but it should&amp;#39;ve been at the house, not the hospital).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I opened the day before Elden Ring&amp;#39;s release, the alarm code my manager let me use since Sept. wasn&amp;#39;t working because he was relocated to another store; the alarm wouldn&amp;#39;t stop for almost 2 hours. The police showed up and I was given my own alarm code. My first bad experience this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manager 2 (The Witch) -&lt;/strong&gt; New manager shows up and she&amp;#39;s terrible. Made us sneak a 1 year warranty onto PS5 bundles. At the time, I was powerless and didn&amp;#39;t want to go against her. I knew it was wrong, though, and reported it to the DM back in June. I also initially quit when I met the DM because &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; manager was mean and demoralizing and made me hate showing up to work (She even made our last ASL quit, possibly due to racism, or just being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; mean). When I told this manager about my meeting with the DM, she told me to &amp;quot;go, move, I mean it&amp;quot;, and I slowly walked out of the back room. Then I propped the door open with a bungie cord and she was all like &amp;quot;why do you need the door open?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So you can watch me do this&amp;quot; I put my keys down in front of her and walked out early that day (no way I was staying with her for 3 more hours...). I even recorded the whole interaction on my phone, but I will keep it for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay -&lt;/strong&gt; New SGA hires are starting at 11, but I was making &lt;strong&gt;8.75&lt;/strong&gt; at that same spot. I was an ASL for the last four and a half months making &lt;strong&gt;12.10&lt;/strong&gt; (11 prior to the pay raise). I&amp;#39;m just thinking of all the money I &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; by working here...I&amp;#39;m happy for my fellow workers but I&amp;#39;m just wondering where the money was for me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost felt bad leaving my (small) team before Black Friday, but I have to look after myself for once. I got close to 15 phone calls one day because they needed help and there was no one. The days off don&amp;#39;t feel like days off. Even now that I quit, I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get some phone calls from work (I answered a few, but now I&amp;#39;m done). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Call -&lt;/strong&gt; My grandfather died in August. Mom called me to tell me to go to his house (I knew what was going to happen). At that moment in time, I was unsure if I were allowed to close the store even for half an hour, and asked my Manager and DM. They should&amp;#39;ve told me to just close for the day (It was slow anyway...), but I will always blame myself in the end for not taking action. I had help arrive about an hour later, and when I recently asked him how many transactions he had while I was gone, he said &amp;quot;about 2&amp;quot; or so. By the time I arrived at the house, the ambulance had already taken him. I even mentioned this in my speech to the whole Church. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not worth it&amp;quot;, I said. &amp;quot;I missed him&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Customers -&lt;/strong&gt; There have been a lot of them lately. So much so that I have been intentionally opening late and closing early. (11 to 7? 12 to 6 for me) My energy and drive were depleted; &lt;strong&gt;I wish the new guys could&amp;#39;ve seen me at my best...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all, I left on good terms with my DM and other workers. I wish them and everyone reading this the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RIP My GameStop Run, May 2021-November 2022.
