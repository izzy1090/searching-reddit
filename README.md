# searching-through-sub-reddits

To use program, create a folder in your desired directory where the repo will live locally, then clone the repo in that directory. 

Create a seperate .env file and use the .env_sample to format the file. Then create a app on reddit with whatever name for your project.

Add your API Key and API Secret to the .env file you created using the .env_sample as a template. 

Finally install the following npm dependencies:

'fs'
npm install fs

'node-fetch' - to use fetch with earlier versions of node
npm install node-fetch

'dotenv'
npm install dotenv

You should be good to go! A cleaner README file will be added in the future.
